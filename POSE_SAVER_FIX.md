# POSE SAVER NODE FIX - Canvas Dimensions Issue RESOLVED

## ‚úÖ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

You were using the **"save json to pose save folder and export all json files to target"** button, which uses the `PoseSaverNode` class. This node was directly saving the pose data without ensuring canvas dimensions were present.

## üîß WHAT WAS FIXED

### **PoseSaverNode Enhancement**
Modified the `save_pose_keypoint` method in `openpose_editor_nodes.py` to:

1. **Always ensure canvas dimensions before saving**
2. **Preserve existing canvas dimensions when present**
3. **Add default dimensions (512√ó768) when missing**

### **Key Changes Made:**

#### 1. Enhanced `save_pose_keypoint` method:
```python
# Ensure canvas dimensions are present before saving
processed_pose_keypoint = self._ensure_canvas_dimensions(pose_keypoint)

with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    json.dump(processed_pose_keypoint, f, indent=4)
```

#### 2. Added `_ensure_canvas_dimensions` method:
```python
def _ensure_canvas_dimensions(self, pose_keypoint):
    """Ensure canvas dimensions are present in the pose data"""
    if pose_keypoint is None:
        return None
    
    # Make a deep copy to avoid modifying the original
    import copy
    processed_data = copy.deepcopy(pose_keypoint)
    
    # Handle different data structures
    if isinstance(processed_data, list):
        # List of pose objects
        for item in processed_data:
            if isinstance(item, dict):
                if 'canvas_width' not in item:
                    item['canvas_width'] = 512
                if 'canvas_height' not in item:
                    item['canvas_height'] = 768
    elif isinstance(processed_data, dict):
        # Single pose object
        if 'canvas_width' not in processed_data:
            processed_data['canvas_width'] = 512
        if 'canvas_height' not in processed_data:
            processed_data['canvas_height'] = 768
    
    return processed_data
```

## üß™ TESTED AND VERIFIED

‚úÖ **Logic test passed**: Canvas dimensions are correctly added  
‚úÖ **Handles list of frames**: Multiple pose frames supported  
‚úÖ **Handles single frames**: Single pose objects supported  
‚úÖ **Preserves existing dimensions**: Won't overwrite existing canvas settings  
‚úÖ **Default values**: Uses 512√ó768 when dimensions are missing  

## üéØ WHAT HAPPENS NOW

When you use the **"save json to pose save folder and export all json files to target"** button:

### ‚úÖ **Before Fix (BROKEN):**
```json
[
  {
    "people": [
      {
        "pose_keypoints_2d": [...],
        "hand_right_keypoints_2d": [...],
        "person_id": [-1]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### ‚úÖ **After Fix (WORKING):**
```json
[
  {
    "canvas_width": 512,
    "canvas_height": 768,
    "people": [
      {
        "pose_keypoints_2d": [...],
        "hand_right_keypoints_2d": [...],
        "person_id": [-1]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## üöÄ HOW TO USE

1. **Restart ComfyUI** to load the updated node code
2. **Use the OpenPose Editor Node** as normal
3. **Click "save json to pose save folder and export all json files to target"**
4. **Your exported JSON files will now include canvas dimensions!**

## üé® CUSTOM CANVAS SIZES

If you want custom canvas dimensions (like 720√ó1280), you have two options:

### **Option 1: Modify Default Values**
Change lines in the `_ensure_canvas_dimensions` method:
```python
item['canvas_width'] = 720   # Instead of 512
item['canvas_height'] = 1280 # Instead of 768
```

### **Option 2: Pre-add Canvas Dimensions**
Ensure your input JSON already has the canvas dimensions you want - the fix will preserve them.

## üèÜ SUMMARY

**The root cause was found and fixed!** 

The `PoseSaverNode` (which handles the export button) was not ensuring canvas dimensions were present when saving JSON files. Now it:

- ‚úÖ **Always adds canvas dimensions to exported JSON**
- ‚úÖ **Uses sensible defaults (512√ó768)**
- ‚úÖ **Preserves existing canvas dimensions when present**
- ‚úÖ **Works with both single and multiple pose frames**

**Your "save json to pose save folder" button will now export complete JSON files with canvas dimensions!** üéâ
